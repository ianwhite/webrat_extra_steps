h1. Creates some extra handy webrat steps

After you've run script/generate cucumber, do this:
  
  script/generate extra_webrat_steps 
  
h2. What does it do?

Currently, it just creates dom scoped versions of the 'When' steps.

So, if you have a page with lots of similar looking text, you can use steps like
this:

  When within: div.crumbs_bar, I press "Home"
  
  When within: form.enquiry, I select "Website" from "Enquiry type"
  
The generator parses your current webrat_steps.rb to create the steps, so if that file changes
you might want to re-run the generator

h3. Enhancement to support multiple languages

It's asumed that the features directory looks as following:
  
    features
      [language] (any other language cucumber supports)
        step_definitions
          *_steps.rb
          webrat_steps.rb
        *.feature
      support
        env.rb
   
Use script/generate extra_webrat_steps [language] to generate webrat_extra_steps.rb
