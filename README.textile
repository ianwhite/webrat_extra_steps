h1. NOTE: "This Gist":http://gist.github.com/239570 supercedes this plugin

I am no longer supporting this plugin.  See the above link for a much better solution.

h2. Creates some extra handy webrat steps

After you've run script/generate cucumber, do this:
  
  script/generate extra_webrat_steps 

h2. What does it do?

Currently, it just creates dom scoped versions of the 'When' steps.

So, if you have a page with lots of similar looking text, you can use steps like
this:

  When within: div.crumbs_bar, I press "Home"
  
  When within: form.enquiry, I select "Website" from "Enquiry type"
  
The generator parses your current webrat_steps.rb to create the steps, so if that file changes
you might want to re-run the generator

h3. Enhancement to support multiple languages

Since Cucumber supports multiple languages, webrat_extra_steps should do so as well.  (The 
currently supported languages are in rails_generators/extra_webrat_steps/tenplates/languages.yml)

It's assumed that the features directory looks as follows:
  
    features/
    +-- [language]/ (any language cucumber supports)
    +-- step_definitions/
         +-- *_steps.rb
         +-- webrat_steps.rb
    +-- *.feature
    +-- [language]/ (multiple languages are supported)
         +-- *
    +-- support/
         +-- env.rb
   
Use script/generate extra_webrat_steps [language] to generate webrat_extra_steps.rb.
If no [language] is given, the generator works as usual.
